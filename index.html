                                        <p> First as a teenager in Boston in the 1960s, then in New York starting in the 1970s, 
                                            Nan Goldin has taken intensely personal, spontaneous, sexual, and transgressive 
                                            photographs of her family, friends, and lovers. In 1979 she presented her first 
                                            slideshow in a New York City nightclub, and her richly colored, snap-shot-like photographs 
                                            were soon heralded as a groundbreaking contribution to fine art photography.

                                        <p> Goldin's first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city's 
                                            gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend

                                            . While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin "fell in with the drag queens," living with them and photographing them.

                                        <p> The AIDS crisis of the 1980s hit the LGBTQ+ community hard. An already ostracised community became further isolated and feared by American society.  
                                            Goldin’s work complemented the activism that grew out of the LBGTQ community during this period by allowing 
                                            for people to see a community they were constantly attempting to look away from. 
                                             
                                             She managed to unravel many of their stories through personal and candid photographs. 
                                             ‘My work has always come from empathy and love’, says American photographer Nan Goldin.

                        <p> In 1993, Goldin published&nbsp;  

                            <a href="https://museemagazine.com/culture/2020/1/16/book-review-nan-goldins-the-other-side" target="_blank">The Other Side<sl-icon name="box-arrow-in-up-right"></sl-icon></a>

                        
                            ,&nbsp;a personal declaration of love and gratitude for the LGBTQ+Community. 
                            Although the pictures represent the charm and allure of drag life, the words Goldin 
                            chose to describe the struggle of those days are often grim. The drag scene in the 
                            previous century was hostile: drag queens were rejected even by the gay community, 
                            and thus did not fall into the most known social categories. To survive, queens 
                            often had to turn to drugs and prostitution, and many lost their lives during the 
                            AIDS epidemic. For Goldin, republishing this book was a way to pay homage to her 
                            dear friends that died in this struggle.

                            <p> Though New York has changed since then, and many of the bodies Goldin captured 
                                are lost (to time, to AIDs, to suicide), Goldin's work continues to evolve, 
                                finding new meaning in a present moment where social neglect and violence 
                                continue to impact those, particularly in the LGBTQ community, who exist in 
                                worlds often unseen by “mainstream” society. <br> <br>


                                 40 million people have lost their lives to HIV since the beginning of the epidemic, and countless. 
                                 Today, researchers around the globe are searching for cures, vaccines and ways to manipulate cells to reduce the impact the virus has on the body.
